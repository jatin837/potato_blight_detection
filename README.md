Blight is a form of plant disease, typically one caused by fungi such as mildews, rusts, and smuts. Several notable examples are:
- Late blight of potato, caused by the water mold (Phytophthora infestans), the disease which led to the Great Irish Famine
- Southern corn leaf blight, caused by the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus, anamorph Bipolaris maydis (Nisikado & Miyake) Shoemaker, incited a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970.
- Bacterial leaf blight of rice, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae (Uyeda & Ishiyama) Dowson.

This is an end-to-end deep learning project to classify status of blight on the potato plant.
